The `fs2-data-json` module provides tools to parse, query and transform JSON data in a streaming manner.

This page covers the following topics:

### Basic usage

To create a stream of JSON tokens from an input stream, use the `tokens` pipe in `fs2.data.json` package. This pipe accepts a stream of characters and returns a stream of JSON tokens. This produces a stream of structurally valid tokens forming the JSON documents.

```scala mdoc
import cats.effect._

import fs2._
import fs2.data.json._

val input = """{
              |  "field1": 0,
              |  "field2": "test",
              |  "field3": [1, 2, 3]
              |}
              |{
              |  "field1": 2,
              |  "field3": []
              |}""".stripMargin

val stream = Stream.emits(input).through(tokens[Fallible])
stream.compile.toList
```

The pipe validates the JSON structure while parsing. It reads all the json values in the input stream and emits tokens as they are available.

### Selectors

Selectors can be used to select a subset of a JSON token stream. There are several ways to create selectors:
 - build the selector using the constructors, which can be quite verbose and cumbersome;
 - parse a string with the selector syntax;
 - use the selector DSL.

#### Parsing a string using the selector syntax

For instance, to select and enumerate elements that are in the `field3` array, you can create this selector. Only the tokens describing the values in `field3` will be emitted as a result.

```scala mdoc
import cats.implicits._

type ThrowableEither[T] = Either[Throwable, T]

val selector = ".field3.[]".parseSelector[ThrowableEither].toTry.get
```

The `parseSelector` method implicitly comes from the `import fs2.data.json._` and wraps the result in anything that has an [`MonadError` with error type `Throwable`][monad-error] to catch potential parsing errors. If you prefer not to have this wrapping and don't mind an extra dependency, you can have a look at [the interpolator][interpolator-doc].

The filter syntax is as follows:
  - `.` selects the root values, it is basically the identity filter.
  - `.f` selects the field named `f` in objects. It fails if the value it is applied to is not a JSON object.
    - `f` must be a valid Java identifier, meaning it has to respect this regular expression: `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. If you wish to select a field that doesn't respect this regular expression, you can use the syntax `.["my non-identifier field"]` described below.
    - name `f` can be immediately followed by a `!` to mark it as mandatory. Stream will fail if the end of the object the selector is applied to is reached and the field was not present in the object.
  - `.f?` is similar to `.f` but doesn't fail in case the value it is applied to is not a JSON object.
    - both `!` and `?` can be combined as `.f!?` to indicate that if the value it is applied to is a JSON object, then the field must be in it.
  - `.["f1", "f2", ..., "fn"]` selects only fields `f1` to `fn` in objects. It fails if the value it is applied to is not an object.
    - the field list can be immediately followed by a `!` to mark all fields as mandatory. Stream will fail if the end of the object the selector is applied to is reached and at least one field in the list was not present in the object.
  - `.["f1", "f2", ..., "fn"]?` is similar to `.["f1", "f2", ..., "fn"]` but doesn't fail if the value it is applied to is not an object.
    - both `!` and `?` can be combined as `.["f1", "f2", ..., "fn"]!?` to indicate that if the value it is applied to is a JSON object, then all the specified fields must be in it.
  - `.[id1, idx2, ..., idxn]` selects only elements `idx1`, ..., `idxn` in arrays. It fails if the value it is applied to is not an array.
  - `.[idx1, idx2, ..., idxn]?` is similar to `.[idx1, idx2, ..., idxn]` but doesn't fail if the value it is applied to is not an array.
  - `.[idx1:idx2]` selects only elements between `idx1` (inclusive) and `idx2` (exclusive) in arrays. It fails if the value it is applied to is not an array.
  - `.[idx1:idx2]?` is similar to `.[idx1:idx2]` but doesn't fail if the value it is applied to is not an array.
  - `.[]` selects and enumerates elements from arrays or objects. It fails if the value it is applied to is not an array or an object.
  - `.[]?` is similar as `.[]` but doesn't fail if the value it is applied to is neither an array nor an object.
  - `sel1 sel2` applies selector `sel1` to the root value, and selector `sel2` to each selected value.

#### Using the selector DSL

The selector DSL is a nice way to describe selectors without using any string parsing. They also allow for programmatically building selectors.
The DSL resides within the `fs2.data.json.selector` package, and you start a selector using the `root` builder.
The selector above can be written like this with the DSL:

```scala mdoc
import fs2.data.json.selector._

val selectorFromDsl = root.field("field3").iterate.compile
```

The `.compile` in the end transforms the previous selector builder from the DSL into the final selector. Builders are safe to reuse, re-compose and compile several times.

You can express the same selectors as with the syntax described above. For instance to make the field mandatory and the iteration lenient you can do:

```scala mdoc:nest
val selectorFromDsl = root.field("field3").!.iterate.?.compile
```

The DSL is typesafe, so that you cannot write invalid selectors. Any attempt to do so results in a compilation error.

```scala mdoc:fail
// array index selection cannot be made mandatory
root.index(1).!
```

```scala mdoc:fail
// you cannot use the same flag twice
root.index(1).?.?
```

#### Using JSON selectors

Using the selector defined above, we can filter the stream of tokens, to only emit selected tokens downstream. This can be used to drastically reduce the amount of emitted data, to only the parts that are of interest for you.

```scala mdoc
val filtered = stream.through(filter(selector))
filtered.compile.toList
```

By default, selected values are emitted in the stream as they are matched, resulting in a stream with several JSON values.
If this is not desired, you can wrap the elements into arrays and objects, from the root by calling `filter` with `wrap` set to `true`.

```scala mdoc
val filteredWrapped = stream.through(filter(selector, wrap = true))
filteredWrapped.compile.toList
```

If the selector selects elements in an array, then the resulting values are wrapped in an array.
On the other hand, if it selects elements in an object, then emitted values are returned wrapped in an object, associated with the last selected keys.

If you want to ensure that selected object keys are present in the JSON value, you can use the `!` operator described above. For instance if you want to select `field2` and fail the stream as soon as an object does not contain it, you can do:

```scala mdoc
val mandatorySelector = ".field2!".parseSelector[ThrowableEither].toTry.get
stream.through(filter(mandatorySelector)).compile.toList
```

The `filter` preserves the chunk structure, so that the stream fails as soon as an error is encountered in the chunk, but first emitting previously selected values in the same chunk.

### AST builder and tokenizer

JSON ASTs can be built if you provider an implicit [`Builder[Json]`][builder-api] to the `values` pipe. The `Builder[Json]` typeclass describes how JSON ASTs of type `Json` are built from streams.

```scala
implicit val builder: Builder[SomeJsonType] = ...
val asts = stream.through(values[F, SomeJsonType])
```

The `asts` stream emits all top-level JSON values parsed, in our example, the two objects are emitted.

If you provide an implicit [`Tokenizer[Json]`][tokenizer-api], which describes how a JSON AST is transformed into JSON tokens, you can apply transformations to the JSON stream. For instance, you can wrap all values in the `fields3` array by using this code:

```scala
implicit tokenizer: Tokenizer[SomeJsonType] = ...
val transformed = stream.through(transform[Fallible, Json](selector, json => SomeJsonObject("test" -> json)))
```
For concrete examples of provided `Builder`s and `Tokenizer`s, please refer to [the JSON library binding modules documentation][json-lib-doc]

Sometimes you would like to delete some Json values from the input stream, based o some predicate at a given path, and keep the rest untouched. In this case, you can use the `transformOpt` pipe, and return `None` for values you want to remove from the stream.

### JSON Renderers

Once you got a JSON token stream, selected and transformed what you needed in it, you can then write the resulting token stream to some storage. This can be achieved using renderers.

For instance, let's say you want to write the resulting JSON stream to a file in compact form (i.e. with no space or new lines), you can do:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
import java.nio.file.Paths

implicit val cs = IO.contextShift(scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global)

Blocker[IO].use { blocker =>
  stream
    .through(render.compact)
    .through(text.utf8Encode)
    .lift[IO]
    .through(io.file.writeAll[IO](Paths.get("/some/path/to/file.json"), blocker))
    .compile
    .drain
}
```

There exists also a `pretty()` renderer, that indents inner elements by the given indent string.

If you are interested in the String rendering as a value, the library also provides [`Collector`s][collector-doc]:

```scala mdoc
stream.compile.to(collector.compact)

// default indentation is 2 spaces
stream.compile.to(collector.pretty())
// if you are more into tabs (or any other indentation size) you can change the indentation string
stream.compile.to(collector.pretty("\t"))
```
